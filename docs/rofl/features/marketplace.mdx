# The ROFL Marketplace

The ROFL marketplace is an on-chain protocol that allows app developers to
easily and safely deploy their apps for a small fee on one side and on the
other enables ROFL node providers to lend their ROFL nodes for computation.

The ROFL marketplace consists of three entities:

- **App developers**: Build an app, register it on-chain and rent a
  machine from the ROFL provider where they can deploy their ROFL to.
- **ROFL provider**: Is an on-chain entity that bills and assigns **machines**
  to ROFL developers. Each machine has a hosting plan called an **offer**.
- **ROFL node**: Is a server that runs the Oasis node and instantiates one or
  more **machines** which then host an app.
