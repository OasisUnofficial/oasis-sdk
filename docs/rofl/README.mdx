# Runtime Off-Chain Logic (ROFL)

*ROFL-powered apps* are applications running on Oasis nodes inside a *Trusted
Execution Environment (TEE)* that are managed through the Oasis Sapphire
blockchain.

ROFL supports:

- **Docker-like containers** or **single-executable** apps depending on your
  TCB demand and threat model
- **Privacy and integrity** through Intel SGX/TDX including fully auditable
  history of updates
- **Uncensorable** registration, management and deployment of your app on a
  permissionless pool of ROFL nodes **including billing**
- **Built-in Key Management Service** (KMS) for storing your app secrets and
  secure derivation of keys within TEE
- **Integration with Oasis Sapphire** enables EVM-compatible smart contracts to
  verify the ROFL transaction origin

ROFL powers private trading and chat bots, provable AI learning, price
oracles, home automation, VPNs and fair gaming!
