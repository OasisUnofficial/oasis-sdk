# Build ROFL-Powered Apps

![ROFL diagram](images/rofl.svg)

*Runtime OFf-chain Logic (ROFL)* is a mechanism to augment the
deterministic on-chain backend with verifiable off-chain applications.
Applications in ROFL are stateless (with support for encrypted persistent local
volumes), have access to the network and can perform expensive and/or
non-deterministic computation.

These apps run in *Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)*, similar to the
on-chain confidential runtimes. This enables them to securely authenticate to
the on-chain backend which is handled transparently by the framework. Together
they allow one to implement secure decentralized oracles, bridges, AI agents and
more.

The following chapters will teach you how to build your own app with the help of
the [Oasis Runtime SDK].
