# Deploy

ROFLs can be deployed to any ParaTime that has the ROFL module installed. Most
common is [Sapphire][sapphire] which implements all ROFL functionalities.

[sapphire]: https://github.com/oasisprotocol/docs/blob/main/docs/build/sapphire/network.mdx

Your app will be deployed to a [ROFL node]. This is a light Oasis Node with
support for TEE and configured Sapphire ParaTime. There are two ways to deploy
your app:

1. The preferred option is to rent a ROFL node using the [ROFL
   marketplace](#deploy-on-rofl-marketplace) and deploy your app
   directly via the [Oasis CLI].
2. Alternatively, you can copy over the ROFL bundle to your ROFL node manually
   and configure it. In this case, consult the [ROFL node &rightarrow; Hosting
   the ROFL bundle directly][rofl-node-hosting] section.

## Deploy on ROFL Marketplace

The Oasis CLI has built-in support for renting a machine on the [ROFL
marketplace][rofl-marketplace] and deploying your app to it. To list offers of
the default Oasis-managed ROFL provider, run:

```shell
oasis rofl deploy --show-offers
```

```
Using provider: oasis1qp2ens0hsp7gh23wajxa4hpetkdek3swyyulyrmz (oasis1qp2ens0hsp7gh23wajxa4hpetkdek3swyyulyrmz)

Offers available from the selected provider:
- playground_short [0000000000000001]
  TEE: tdx | Memory: 4096 MiB | vCPUs: 2 | Storage: 19.53 GiB
  Price: 5.0 TEST/hour
```

You can select a different provider and offer by using the
[`--provider`][oasis-rofl-deploy] and [`--offer`][oasis-rofl-deploy] parameters
respectively.

For now, let's just go with defaults and execute:

```shell
oasis rofl deploy
```

```
Using provider: oasis1qp2ens0hsp7gh23wajxa4hpetkdek3swyyulyrmz (oasis1qp2ens0hsp7gh23wajxa4hpetkdek3swyyulyrmz)
Pushing ROFL app to OCI repository 'rofl.sh/0ba0712d-114c-4e39-ac8e-b28edffcada8:1747909776'...
No pre-existing machine configured, creating a new one...
Taking offer: playground_short [0000000000000001]
```

The command above performed the following actions:

1. copied over ROFL bundle .orc to an Oasis-managed OCI repository `rofl.sh`,
2. paid an offer `playground_short` with ID `0000000000000001` to provider
`oasis1qp2ens0hsp7gh23wajxa4hpetkdek3swyyulyrmz`,
3. obtained the machine ID and stored it to the manifest file.

You can check the status of your active ROFL machine by invoking:

```shell
oasis rofl machine show
```

```

This shows you the details of the machine, including:

- Machine status and expiration date
- Provider information
- Proxy URLs for any published ports
- Resource allocation (TEE type, memory, CPUs, storage)
- Deployment details

You can also fetch the logs of your app by invoking the following command and
signing the request with app's admin account:

```shell
oasis rofl machine logs
```

:::danger Logs are not encrypted!

While only app admin can access the logs they are stored **unencrypted on the
ROFL node**. In production, make sure you never print any confidential data to
the standard or error outputs!

## Check That the App is Running

To check out all active app replicas regardless of the deployment procedure, use
the following command:

```shell
oasis rofl show
```

```
App ID:        rofl1qqn9xndja7e2pnxhttktmecvwzz0yqwxsquqyxdf

Here you can see that a single instance of the app is running on the given node,
its public runtime attestation key (RAK) and the epoch at which its
registration will expire if not refreshed. Apps in ROFL must periodically
refresh their registrations to ensure they don't expire.
